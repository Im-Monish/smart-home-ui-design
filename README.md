# Smart Home App Design – UI/UX

📌 **Project Overview**  
This project represents a UI/UX design for a Smart Home App created using Figma. The design focuses on controlling smart devices in a home, such as lights, fans, and AC units, with user-friendly controls and real-time monitoring of energy consumption.

🎯 **Objective**  
- Provide users with an intuitive way to control and monitor smart devices in their homes.
- Offer features like device on/off controls, consumption tracking, and service requests.
- Use familiar design patterns for easy navigation and clear functionality.

👥 **Target Users**  
- Homeowners using smart devices.
- Users interested in monitoring energy consumption.
- People who want to control their smart devices remotely.

🧠 **Design Process**  
- Analyzed existing smart home apps and identified key user actions (control devices, monitor usage, request services).
- Focused on usability, clear labeling, and ease of navigation.
- Designed a responsive UI using Figma to create a visually engaging and functional interface.

🧩 **Page Structure & UI Sections**

1️⃣ **Device Control Page**  
   - Allows users to view and control smart devices like fans, lights, and AC units.
   - Features a list of devices, their status (on/off), and the ability to turn them on or off.

2️⃣ **Connectivity & Device Status Page**  
   - Displays the current connectivity status of the smart home system.
   - Shows which devices are turned on and their operational status.

3️⃣ **Service Requests Page**  
   - Users can view and request services for devices that require maintenance or troubleshooting.
   - Includes contact options for each device that needs attention.
